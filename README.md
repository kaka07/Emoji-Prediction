# Emoji-Prediction

Predicting emoji's based on some pre-existing data, using the emoji package available in python.

The model is trained using some pre-trained models like LSTM, and the concept used to train the model is base on the approach known as "Transfer Learning", where we don't need to train the model again and again but we can use some available pre-trained models.
